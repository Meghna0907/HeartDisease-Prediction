# HeartDisease-Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a personal has heart disease or not given the clinical parameters.

Data has been collected from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

In this project, a machine learning classification approach is used. The following algorithms are used and compared:
1) Logistic Regression
2) KNN
3) Random Forest Classifier

Here, Random Forest classifier works best. Therefore hyperparameter tuning is done on the same using Randomized SearchCV.
